## Senior iOS Engineer

I build, lead, and ship iOS apps used by millions. Over the last {{ site.years_experience }}+ years I’ve delivered high‑impact releases for Day One at Automattic, WordPress Mobile, and leading banks in Paraguay.

### Highlights
- Day One iPad redesign: shipped 3‑column layout in 3 months with 99.9% crash‑free sessions
- WordPress Mobile: led community refocus to core features across a massive codebase
- Banking apps: delivered secure, top‑ranked Finance apps with biometrics and server‑driven UI

### Expertise
Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, StoreKit, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Unit Testing, CI/CD

### How I work
- Remote‑first, async collaboration, clear written communication
- Product‑minded: partner with design and PM to ship outcomes, not just code
- Pragmatic engineering: tests, metrics, and progressive rollout
