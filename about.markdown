# About Paul Von Schrottky

## From Paraguay to Silicon Valley Impact - Remotely

I'm a **Senior iOS Engineer** with over 10 years of experience building applications that reach millions of users worldwide. What makes my story unique? I've achieved Silicon Valley-level impact while working remotely from Paraguay, proving that geography doesn't limit excellence.

## My Remote Leadership Journey

### The Automattic Experience (5+ Years)
**Where Remote Work Became My Superpower**

Joining **Automattic** - the fully distributed company behind WordPress.com - was transformative. Working on **Day One**, the award-winning journaling app, I learned what true remote excellence looks like:

- **Led critical subscription infrastructure rebuilding** using SwiftUI, resulting in 15% conversion improvement
- **Managed complex StoreKit integrations** serving millions of paying users
- **Coordinated across 15+ timezones** with teams in San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and beyond
- **Mentored junior developers remotely** using pair programming and structured code reviews
- **Owned end-to-end feature delivery** without traditional oversight - pure async execution

The experience taught me that **remote work isn't just about location flexibility** - it's about **owning outcomes, communicating with precision, and delivering consistently** across cultures and timezones.

### WordPress Mobile Leadership
**Turning Technical Skills into Business Impact**

As **Mobile Lead** for WordPress Mobile, I combined technical expertise with business acumen:

- **Generated $100K in revenue** through strategic mobile plan implementations
- **Led cross-functional initiatives** with marketing, design, and backend teams
- **Delivered the Verse Block feature** enabling creative writing for millions of users
- **Architected scalable solutions** that supported WordPress's massive user base

This role proved that **remote leadership** means taking initiative, driving results, and building consensus without in-person meetings.

- **Crash monitoring mastery** with Sentry and Crashlytics

## The Remote Work Difference

**üöÄ Startup to Enterprise Experience**

## Let's Build the Future Together

The future of work is distributed. The best talent isn't constrained by geography. I've spent **5+ years proving this at Automattic** and want to bring that same excellence to your iOS projects.

Whether you're a **Silicon Valley startup** looking to move fast, an **established company** needing to scale mobile, or a **remote-first organization** building the next generation of applications - I bring the experience, skills, and remote-work mastery to exceed your expectations.
