## Project Overview

Day One is the award-winning journaling app trusted by millions of users worldwide. As part of the Automattic team, I worked on critical subscription and monetization features that directly impact user experience and business revenue.

### Technical Architecture

The project involved rebuilding core subscription functionality using modern iOS development practices:

- **SwiftUI Framework**: Migrated legacy UIKit subscription flows to SwiftUI
- **StoreKit 2**: Implemented Apple's latest in-app purchase frameworks
- **Combine**: Used reactive programming for robust state management
- **Sentry Integration**: Real-time crash monitoring and error tracking

### Key Features Delivered

#### Subscription Management Interface
- Redesigned subscription settings with SwiftUI
- Improved user flow for plan upgrades and downgrades
- Added subscription status indicators and renewal information

#### In-App Purchase Flow
- Seamless purchase experience with loading states
- Comprehensive error handling for network failures
- Restored purchases functionality for device transfers

#### Crash Monitoring & Resolution
- Integrated Sentry for real-time crash reporting
- Identified and fixed edge-case crashes in subscription flow
- Improved app stability metrics significantly

### Remote Development at Scale

This project exemplified effective remote development practices:

- **Distributed Team**: Collaborated with team members across San Francisco, London, and other time zones
- **Async Communication**: Managed feature delivery through comprehensive documentation and async updates
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintained high code quality through rigorous code reviews and testing

The Day One project demonstrates my ability to work on high-impact features for millions of users while maintaining the quality and reliability expected of a premium iOS application.
