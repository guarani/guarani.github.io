A book a week is a worthy new year's resolution for 2017. I was inspired by Susan Fowler's post, [The 52 Books of 2016](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/12/12/the-52-books-of-2016) and have a few books I know I want to read, and many more I'm sure to discover. Here are the books I have read so far this year:

* Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, by Philip K. Dick
* Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, by Ashlee Vance
* The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain
* The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Heminway
* The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, by C. S. Lewis
