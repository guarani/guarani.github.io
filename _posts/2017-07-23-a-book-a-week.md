excerpt: "My 2017 resolution to read a book a week - sharing the journey and the books that have shaped my year so far."

A book a week is a worthy new year's resolution for 2017. I was inspired by Susan Fowler's post, [The 52 Books of 2016](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/12/12/the-52-books-of-2016) and have a few books I know I want to read, and many more I'm sure to discover. 

Here are the books I have read so far this year:

* **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep**, by Philip K. Dick
* **Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future**, by Ashlee Vance
* **The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn**, by Mark Twain
* **The Old Man and the Sea**, by Ernest Hemingway
* **The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe**, by C. S. Lewis

### Why Read So Much?

As a software engineer, continuous learning is essential. While technical books and documentation are crucial for staying current with iOS development, fiction and non-fiction outside of tech provide:

- **Different perspectives** on problem-solving
- **Enhanced creativity** through exposure to diverse storytelling
- **Better communication skills** through varied writing styles
- **Mental breaks** from code that often lead to breakthrough moments

The Elon Musk biography, in particular, provided fascinating insights into how someone can manage multiple cutting-edge companies simultaneously - lessons that apply to managing complex iOS projects and remote team coordination.

### The Challenge Continues

Reading consistently has become one of my most rewarding habits. Whether it's during my commute, before bed, or during breaks between coding sessions, books provide a constant source of learning and inspiration.

What are you reading this year? I'm always looking for recommendations!
